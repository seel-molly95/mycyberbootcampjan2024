# Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.

# When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".

# When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".`

#   And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"

# You will need to use a for loop to write this:


#Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡

for my_program in range(1, 101):
    if my_program % 15 == 0:
        print("FizzBuzz")
    elif my_program % 3 == 0:
        print("Fizz")
    elif my_program % 5 == 0:
        print("Buzz")
    
    else: 
        print(my_program)
