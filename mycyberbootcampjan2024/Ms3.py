# Here is a short story:
# Once upon a time in Appleland, John had three apples, Mary had five apples, and Adam had six apples. They were all very happy and lived for a long time. End of story.
# Your task is to:
# create the variables: john, mary, and adam;
john = 3
mary = 5
adam = 6
# assign values to the variables. The values must be equal to the numbers of fruit possessed by John, Mary, and Adam respectively;
# having stored the numbers in the variables, print the variables on one line, and separate each of them with a comma;
print(john, mary, adam)
# now create a new variable named total_apples equal to the addition of the three previous variables.
total_apples = john + mary + adam
# print the value stored in total_apples to the console;
print("total number of apples:")

# experiment with your code: create new variables, assign different values to them, and perform various arithmetic operations on them (e.g., +, -, *, /, //, etc.). Try to print a string and an integer together on one line, e.g., "Total number of apples:" and total_apples.
a = 31
b = 5
c = 16
sum=a-b
diff=c-a
product=b*a
quotient=a*c
remainder=a%b
floordivision=c//b
print("the difference obetween",a,"and",b, "and", c,"is:",sum)
print("the product of",c,"and",b,"and", a,"is:",product)
print("the quotient of", a,"and",c,"and", b,"is:",quotient)
print("the remainder of",a,"and",b,"and", c,"is:",remainder)
